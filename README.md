## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (you can use a local instance or MongoDB Atlas for a cloud database)
- [Stripe Account](https://stripe.com/) (for payment processing)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   https://github.com/SardarAmiri/golbahar-server.git
   cd golbahar-server

   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   npm install
3. Set up your MongoDB database:
   If using MongoDB locally, make sure it is running.
   If using MongoDB Atlas, create a cluster and obtain the connection string.
4. Set up Stripe:
   Create a Stripe account and get your API keys for payment processing.

## Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory of the backend project. Here are the required environment variables:

```javascript
PORT = 5000;
MONGO_URI = your - mongodb - connection - string;
JWT_SECRET = your - secret - key;
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = your - stripe - secret - key;
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = your - stripe - publishable - key;
```

Ensure to replace the placeholder values (your-mongodb-connection-string, etc.) with the actual values.

## Running the Backend Locally

1. Run the backend development server:'
   nodemon server

   This will start the server at http://localhost:5000. The backend API will be served at this URL.

2. Testing API Endpoints:

You can test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or through the frontend once it is connected.
